# Ultimaker Format Package (UFP)

## Purpose:

The goal of this file type is to provide required data for the 3D printer to perform a print job.

## Structure:

A UFP file contains the following files:</br>
`\.rels`</br>
`\Metadata\thumbnail.png`</br>
`\Cura\`</br>
`\3D\model.gcode`</br>
`\[Content_Types].xml`</br>

* The rels and content type files are filled with the required XML data.
* The thumbnail.png is a medium sized rendering of the 3D shape to show during file selection. There can be only one thumbnail.
* The model.gcode describes how a 3D printer should print a job.
* Possible content of Cura folder :
  * *.xml.fdm_material â€“ files describe materials specifications which might be needed for a print job.

## Notes:

* For the interchange of files between the Slicer and Printers, currently, ASCII GCODE files are used, in a specific Ultimaker flavor.
* In future development, the content of folder Cura might be changed.
